Internal linkage is the variable which is only visible only in the
translation unit in which is declared. for example, the static variable
itemno in my CString.cpp file. However, external linkage means that variable
declared in one translation unit is visible to other translation unit. 
In our workshop, we declare the variable INITIAL globally, which is a external
linkage. We declare and definite it in the w1.cpp file, but can use it in the
CString.cpp file, which is in the CString translation unit.

	In the process() function, we use the one argument constructor function
to create an tempory CString object, and assign it to a CString object named a.
The effect is actually received the string from the command line, and then store
it in a local variable in process module and then output it.

	In order to receive a string in any length, we need to allocate dynamic
memory to the String object we defined.so we first use the strlen function to
get the length of the string we received, and then allocated memory size plus one
accordingly, then store the string in the String object.
